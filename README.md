# UCC-Interpreter-01
A repository for various interpreter implementations

## Python

Based on [py-myopl-code](https://github.com/davidcallanan/py-myopl-code)

An interpretter in python for the Basic language, implemented as different exercises. 

### Python setup

You can setup a virtual environment in python with these commands. 

    sudo apt install python3.8-venv
    python3 -m venv .venv

Later you can check in the requirements.txt file so other developers can pickup the new virtual environment. 

Tip: When you're ready to deploy the application to other computers, you can create a requirements.txt file with the command pip freeze > requirements.txt (pip3 on macOS/Linux). The requirements file describes the packages you've installed in your virtual environment. With only this file, you or other developers can restore those packages using pip install -r requirements.txt (or, again, pip3 on macOS/Linux). By using a requirements file, you need not commit the virtual environment itself to source control.
